1. Time series classification:

Time series classification using Dynamic Time Warping with different distance measures and K-Nearest Neighbor.
Different distance measures with Dynamic Time Warping produce different classification accuracy as well as differ in the time taken for the entire classification process.

Euclidean distance performs the best with respect to performance accuracy, but Normalized Euclidean distance performs better when it comes to time taken for the classification to take place.
